~~first time opening, choose puzzle pack menu doesn't go away~~


- create task menu goes away after choosing type?
- no way to cancel deleting task/etc. (Forces them to delete one)
	- can only delete one at a time
- delete key shouldn't close the application
- press escape to work on puzzle needs explanation/a more intuitive way to do it
- Explain that clicking on habits marks them finished
- right click rotates pieces explanation/tooltip
- add a label for this [TYPE OF] habit
- don't allow slash in habit labels (unless inside brackets)

- Interval multi-part tasks (i.e. laundry) will behave counter-intuitively (i.e. it tells you to dry your laundry a week after washing it)
	- but sometimes the counter-intuitive behavior may be wanted
